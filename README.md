# SimpsonGANS
## Personal Project

### Year
2022

### Overview
This project explores the domain of image generation by leveraging an existing dataset, MedNIST, to create new X-ray images of various body parts. In a parallel endeavor, the project also experiments with generating new faces of characters from "Simpsons" using their facial images. The aim is to showcase the capabilities of modern image generation techniques and to explore their potential applications in medical imaging and entertainment.

### Features
- **MedNIST Dataset Utilization**: Uses the MedNIST dataset for generating new X-ray images, enhancing the diversity of medical imaging data.
- **Simpsons Characters Imaging**: Applies image generation techniques to the faces of characters from "The Simpsons," aiming to create new, unique character faces.
- **Diverse Application**: Demonstrates the versatility of image generation techniques across vastly different domains - medical imaging and animated character creation.

### Functionality
This project employs generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) to generate new X-ray images from the MedNIST dataset and faces of "Simpsons" characters. It aims to showcase GANs' ability to create realistic and diverse images for medical research and entertainment.

### How It Works
GANs work by training two models in tandem: a generator that creates images and a discriminator that evaluates their authenticity. By iterating through cycles of generation and discrimination, the system learns to produce images that closely mimic the original datasets, resulting in high-quality, synthetic X-ray and Simpsons character images.
